### Solar Energy Output Submodel

We downloaded raster data from Cal-Adapt using the the CCSM3 climate model under an A2 emissions scenario. To create the solar energy output submodel we used projected monthly minimumum, maximum, and average temperatures as well as net solar insolation data in California for 2020 and 2050. Running this submodel for two different years allows us to conduct analyses on projected change in solar energy output across California. For example, from 2020 to 2050 we can see that generally solar energy output is projected to increase in Northern California and decrease in southeastern California (Figure 1).

To make our final solar suitability map of California for 2020, we needed to average solar energy output by county (Figure 2).

### Economic Submodel

For the economic submodel, we first downloaded assessed land value data from CA BOE, and calculated the unit land value ($c_{unit land}$, in $\$/m^2$) for each county. To do this, we calculated the area of each county, then divided the total value by the area.

Then, we got the instant cost ($c_{instant}: \$1585/kW$), the installed cost ($c_{installed}: \$1861/kW$), and the O&M cost ($c_{om}:\$8.12/MWh$) from the CA Energy Conmission. We assumed to install a $20000 m^2$) (A) solar farm in every county (about 5 acres), which will operate for 10 years (t).

Finally, we took the energy generation from the solar energy submodel ($gen_{unit}$).

\begin{equation}
LCOE = \frac{(A*gen_{unit}*c_{instant}+A*gen_{unit}*c_{installed}+A*t*gen_{unit}*c_{om}+A*c_{unit land})}{A*t*gen_{unit}}
\end{equation}
